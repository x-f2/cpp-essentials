# cpp-essentials
Some files I wrote that I consider useful for writing C++ code.

## Makefile
This is my template for makefiles. To keep it simple I made an annotated version and an unannotated version which explains how it works.

## Object
This is a datatype similar to Map. It consists of key/value pairs, and has some neat prototypes to make for easy handling of data.
